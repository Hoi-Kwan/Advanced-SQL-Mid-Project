# Mid-Project: Analysing Company 8-Month Performance
I have been hired as an E-Commerce Database Analayst for Maven Fuzzy Factory, a fictive online retailer which has been in the market for ~8 months. As a member of the startup team, I will work with the CEO, the Marketing Director and the Website Manager to help steer the business.

# The Situation
The CEO is due to present company performance metrics to the board next week. I will be preparing relevant metrics to show the company’s promising growth.

# The Objective
Use SQL to extract and analyze website traffic and performance data from the Maven Fuzzy Factory database to quantify the company’s growth, and to tell the story of how you have been able to generate that growth.
