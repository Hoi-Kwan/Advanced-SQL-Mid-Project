# Analysing-Website-Traffic-and-Performance-Data
I extracted and analysed website traffic and performance data from the Maven Fuzzy Factory database to quantify the company's growth, and to tell the story of how it has been able to generate that growth.

# Traffic Analysis Tasks <br>
1. pull monthly trends for Gsearch channel sessions and orders to showcase generall growth <br>
2. pull monthly trends for Gsearch channel sessions and orders, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately <br>
3. for Gsearch nonbrand, pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type <br>
4. pull monthly session trends for Gsearch and other channels <br>

# Performance Analysis Tasks <br>
5. pull session to order conversion rate, by month <br>
6. the company created a new homepage for Gsearch channel and it has been tested for 06/19-07/28, so estimate the revenue from the testing period <br> 
7. build a full conversion funnel from each of the landing pages to orders for 06/19-07/28 <br>
8. quantify the impact of a new billing page by analysing the revenue per billing session and number of billing page session for the last month to understand total monthly impact <br>
